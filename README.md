This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Separate Components and Responsive Views

-In this code I also include an example of separating the components, although I don't separate all of them, the method will be like that.

-I also demonstrated the responsive method in SCSS, even though some resolution pixel sizes may not work.

The following is a list of pixel resolutions that I tested:

- 1440
- 1024
- 768
- 425
- 375
- 320

## Deploy on Vercel
